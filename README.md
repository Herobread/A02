# CS1007 Coursework

Example:

```bash
./fetch-data.sh directoryname baseurl
```

```bash
./filter.sh directoryname
```

## Feedback

Minor:
It would be useful to provide the matriculation number at the beginning of the scripts as a preamble, although this has had no impact on the grade for the current submission.

The script seems ok. Might there be any merit in including the -b flag for the du command?
