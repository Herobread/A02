Overall, script is trying to select 5 largest files. 


First, it checks if the number of arguments is correct.

Secondly, line 9 is a big line of piped commands

du -h $1/data/* |sed 's/\.\d*//g' |sed 's/K/000/g'| sort |head -n5

1. du -h $1/data/*
this checks space occupied by the files in the data folder, that were downloaded using the fetch-data script in human readable format(-h argument) by using the disk usage command

2. sed 's/\.\d*//g'
this removes the decimal point, this can lead to loss of data

3. sed 's/K/000/g'
replace K with 000. This works only for kilobytes, so files with bigger sizes, for example megabytes wouldn't work

4. sort
sorts file sizes alphabetically, which wouldn't work for numbers as it doesn't consider their actual values

5. head -n5
gets first 5 lines
